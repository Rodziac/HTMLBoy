# HTMLBoy
This is a gameboy made with HTML, JS, CSS.
There will be a game inside in the future.
The game will be able to be controlled with on screen gameboy buttons or keyboard.
It is full responsive so it works on computer, tablet, phone, 3ds.
Using as native javascript as possible, for maximum compatibility.

## Challenge
Resizing the gameboy, screen container, screen, game tiles according to browser size is too hard, because screen should only be able to contain no more or less than 10 full tiles, and the whole thing shouldn't lose it's proportions and looks while resizing.
